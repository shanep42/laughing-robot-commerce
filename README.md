## Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Challenge: E-commerce Back End

### Description
The goal of this project was to build a backend for a preexisting e-commerce site that would allow for CRUD operations on different modeled objects and interaction with the database through API calls.

### Installation/Usage
After "npm install"ing all dependencies, you will still need to create a .env file in the root directory with your SQL credentials, as well as software like Insomnia or Postman to allow you to make API requests without a fleshed-out frontend.
